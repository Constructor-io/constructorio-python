# Constructor-IO Python Client [![Build](https://travis-ci.org/Constructor-io/constructorio-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Constructor-io/constructorio-python) [![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/constructor-io.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/constructor-io)

A Python package for the [Constructor.io API](http://constructor.io/docs).  Constructor.io provides a lightning-fast, typo-tolerant autocomplete service that ranks your users' queries by popularity to let them find what they're looking for as quickly as possible.

Installation
===

With pip:

    pip install constructor-io

Note that you are writing `constructor-io` with a hyphen, as opposed to actually in your code, where you will be writing `constructor_io` with an underscore!

API
===

All of these are basically one step away from the RESTFUL interface and the implementation is dead simple.
